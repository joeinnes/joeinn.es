This is not going to win any awards, but is a nice, rounded coffee which is not overly expensive considering how much coffee we drink. It's roasted quite dark, but not so dark that you can't taste any flavours.

Although that's how I prefer it (nice and dark), unfortunately Ada does not. Although initially she said 'it's OK', rather unconvinced, she later admitted she doesn't actually likely this coffee very much.

Still, 1kg will last for a while, maybe she'll come around...
