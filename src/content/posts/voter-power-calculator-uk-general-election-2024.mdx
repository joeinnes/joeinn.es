excerpt: As has become my habit, posting my voter power calculator for the 2024 elections to highlight the unfairness of the First Past The Post system. While part of me is celebrating that Reform got so few seats, it's worth checking out how under-represented they are in parliament compared to the number of folks who voted for them.

import VoterPowerCalculator from
  '../../components/VoterPowerCalculator.svelte';

I voted for:

    <VoterPowerCalculator year={2024} client:only="svelte" />

Note that votes for the speaker are excluded from calculations. If you voted for
a candidate belonging to a party not on this list, then your vote was effectively
worthless.
