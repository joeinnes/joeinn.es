I've been with Garden for three months now, and I'm starting to feel the rhythm. I'm enjoying the work, and I feel like I've shipped some useful and interesting work (you can see more details at https\://joeinn.es/i-shipped).

There's more to come, and I'm excited for the future of Jazz!

## Personal

* Sadly, I don't think I'm going to manage 12 apps in 2025, unless I squeeze out a bunch of low-polish, low-quality apps in December, which is not what the intention was. I've got some very good reasons for not having achieved it, and I'm not devastated, but it is disappointing to admit that this is a missed goal.
* For complex reasons, I'm off track for both of my other key targets too: books read and guitar playing. Unfortunately I doubt those will recover any time soon, although I will try to get some reading done over the holidays.
