Starting a new job, complete shift of perspective in terms of my career and future. As a result, obviously I've had to update my personal website.

## Personal

* My '12 apps for 2025' has fallen badly off track, but I'm OK with it, because I'm moving over to work on something very exciting: I've started at Garden Computing, working on [Jazz](https://jazz.tools)
* My guitar playing is continuing to improve, although I'm finding it tricky to get the motivation to practise. I really need to build it back into my daily routine.
* I'm at 14 out of 26 books so far in 2025 (53% of the target with 64% of the year done). A little catching up to do, but mostly I'm pleased. I cheated a little with a lot of shorter books, The Murderbot Diaries series. Don't regret it at all though, they were great.
