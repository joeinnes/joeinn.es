title: Now
---
Living in beautiful Budapest where the summer is in full swing (and I am super glad we got air conditioning installed last spring). Trying to child-proof a small flat to be suitable for an exceptionally curious one year old, who consistently finds new ways to access plug sockets, cables and chargers, cat food and litter, and sharp objects.

## Personal

- Studying for the _Alkotmány Alapismeritek_ test (civics test for Hungarian citizenship).
- Rebuilding my personal website (this one that you're reading) to use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), Markdown (through [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/), allowing me to use Svelte components in Markdown which is pretty cool) and using [Sveltia](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) as the CMS (Sveltia is a rebuild of [Netlify/Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) adding a few cool features - it's faster, looks nicer, has [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) integration, local git editing, etc.).
- Trying to perfect the lazy man's sourdough—constructing a beautiful sourdough loaf with a large crumb (but not too large to use for sandwiches), good oven spring and a nice crust with a good ear. I'm getting there, but since I lost the paddle for my bread machine, I think the kneading stage is suffering, and my loaves are not coming out as good as they were previously. Also since I've been in the office a lot more recently, I think my starter is a bit less active.
- Struggling to find time to play guitar.

## Work

- Going back to [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com) for my to-do list. I've written before about various productivity systems and tools, but none of them ever seem to stick. TeuxDeux is the closest I've found.
- Trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note taking. I'm trying to be a bit more rigorous in note-taking, and Obsidian as a tool mostly seems to get out of my way and lets me make notes. There's a little bit of 'productivity paralysis' when you scroll through all the plugins, but I've opted to keep the number of plugins minimal (just the defaults, plus a calendar, a tables plugin, and a frame hoster so I can have TeuxDeux in a panel in Obsidian too).
- Working on a project to improve our current account-wise reporting scorecards and unify into a single, searchable and indexable format.
