Drinking and eating too much as we approach the holidays, and excited about heading back to the UK to visit family, and spend Christmas with my sister, brother-in-law, and little niece.

## Personal
- **Still** studying for the _Alkotm√°ny Alapismeritek_ test (civics test for Hungarian citizenship).
- Building a 'safe' social network for sending quick audio, video, and text-based ephemeral messages in 'circles'.
- Using my new stand mixer to mix up sourdough, but struggling with the fact that I'm not very experienced making sourdough in colder temperatures.
- Failing to find time to play guitar.

## Work
- Planning has begun for a new Team Lead Assessment Centre in Q4 FY24.
- Looking at how we can attract more technical roles to Central and Eastern Europe.
