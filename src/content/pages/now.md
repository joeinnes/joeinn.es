Trying to stay warm and dry as the autumn sets in in earnest in Budapest. Continuing to (attempt to) child-proof a small flat to be suitable for my son as the months pass and he gets closer to 2.

## Personal

- Still studying for the _Alkotmány Alapismeritek_ test (civics test for Hungarian citizenship).
- Working on a budgeting app to try to work out where all our money goes from one month to the next.
- Trying to perfect the lazy man's sourdough—constructing a beautiful sourdough loaf with a large crumb (but not too large to use for sandwiches), good oven spring and a nice crust with a good ear. I'm getting there, but since I lost the paddle for my bread machine, I think the kneading stage is suffering, and my loaves are not coming out as good as they were previously.
- Struggling to find time to play guitar.

## Work

- Still working with [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com) for my to-do list. I've written before about various productivity systems and tools, but none of them ever seem to stick. TeuxDeux is the closest I've found to perfection.
- Trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note taking. I'm trying to be a bit more rigorous in note-taking, and Obsidian as a tool mostly seems to get out of my way and lets me make notes. There's a little bit of 'productivity paralysis' when you scroll through all the plugins, but I've opted to keep the number of plugins minimal (just the defaults, plus a calendar, a tables plugin, and a frame hoster so I can have TeuxDeux in a panel in Obsidian too).
