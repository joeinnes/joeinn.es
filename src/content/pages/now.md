Happy that the days are getting longer again, despite the cooler weather.

## Personal
- **Still** studying for the _Alkotm√°ny Alapismeritek_ test (civics test for Hungarian citizenship).
- Building a 'safe' social network for sending quick audio, video, and text-based ephemeral messages in 'circles', but stuck on using worker_threads in SvelteKit, and not quite ready to give up on it yet because it feels like I'm *nearly* there, despite the fact everyone is telling me just to spin up another application to take care of it.
- Using my new stand mixer to mix up sourdough, but struggling with the fact that I'm not very experienced making sourdough in colder temperatures.
- Taking guitar lessons to improve my skills, which is fun and going well.
