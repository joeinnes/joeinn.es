My son is at kindergarten now and picking up every sickness going. But he's talking and exploring the world, and becoming an amazing little person.

## Personal

- I bought a Nuuna notebook and it's *beautiful*. I love using it, and it's making me very happy. Journalling is helping me to keep my thoughts organised.
- I'm also enjoying writing with a fountain pen, even though my handwriting is dreadful.
- We've all been a bit under the weather this winter, seems there's been a bit of a sickness bug going around.
- I feel like my guitar playing is getting better and better, although still a long way to go before I feel confident enough to write or record anything.
- I've set myself a target for 26 books read in 2025, and I'm doing really well so far, I've already finished six books. I'm enjoying being further and further away from social media.
- I've also set myself a weight target which I'm progressing towards quite well. With the exception of April 2024, I'm the lightest I've been since 2019, and soon I'm expecting to be able to cross out the exception.
- I'm listening to [1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/) mostly while I'm working  and I'm finding it's bringing some variety to my music listening, but the majority of it is not actually that great.
- I set myself a challenge to write 12 apps this year and 'publish' them. So far, I launched one in Jan, and I'm on track to launch my second in Feb.
