Male bees are all essentially clones of their mothers, and female bees inherit 100% of their father’s genetic material and 50% of their mother’s, meaning that male bees are genetically identical to their brothers, and female bees are 75% related to their sisters while they are 50% related to their offspring (the other 50% coming from the father).
