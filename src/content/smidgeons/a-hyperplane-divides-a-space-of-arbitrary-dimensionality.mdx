This boggled my brain a bit at first, but it's less complicated than it sounds. If you have a one-dimensional space (i.e. a line), you can draw a dot at any point on the line to divide it. If you have a two-dimensional space (i.e. a surface), you can draw a line across the surface to divide it. If you have a three-dimensional space, you can put a plane through it to divide it.&#x20;

If you're doing something like facial recognition with embeddings in a 128-dimensional space, you can put a hyperplane through that space to divide it.

This is useful for [LSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) (or 'fuzzy matching' in hyperdimensional space).
