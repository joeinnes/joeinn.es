summary: "Apple Music doesn't let you see the 'last played' date of any tracks which are not in your library"

And given that it doesn't integrate with Last.fm, it's a bit of a pain.

**Problem statement:**
_I want to have a list of all the music I've listened to <del>on Apple Music.</del>_

**Challenges**

1. I listen to Apple Music on my iPhone, my iPad, my personal MacBook (using the Music app exclusively), my work MacBook (using the Music app), and my work Windows laptop (using the Apple Music web interface).
2. Apple Music does not offer (or at least, not in a way that I've found) the possibility to get the last played date of a track which is **not** in your library.
3. Apple Music doesn't integrate with tools like Last.fm to be able to 'scrobble' listens in realtime (and further, Last.fm is blocked on my work computers).
4. Spotify also is blocked on my work computers, so that's not a solution either
