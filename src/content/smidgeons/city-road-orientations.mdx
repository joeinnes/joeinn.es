From [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/city-street-orientations-world/).

In some countries (US, Canada, Spain/Japan to a lesser extent) this is a result of deliberate planning. Outside of the US, it looks like there are a couple of key factors:

- Where the city is coastal (e.g. Bangkok, Barcelona, Dubai, Lagos, Melbourne) the orientation is perpendicular to the coastline, with the longest roads leading away from the sea
- Where the city has a river running through the centre (e.g. Budapest, Cairo, Warsaw)

**Exceptions**
There are more exceptions than cities that actually support my hypothesis, but the world is a funny place:

- Berlin, but there are potentially political reasons for this
- Hong Kong, likely due to its topography (Hong Kong is squeezed in between mountains and the sea)
- Moscow, but the Moskva river does not flow neatly from one side of the map to the other, it snakes its way from North West to South East taking lots of backwards and forwards turns
- Mumbai, which is built on a peninsula, limiting the number of roads which can go perpendicular to the coastline
- Rio, which is built on the mouth of a bay
- Rome, which is an interesting exception. I can't really see why this is. The Tiber does meander somewhat but has a clear North/South direction.
- Tehran is inland, but seems to pick up its polarity from the Caspian Sea to the North, so not fully an exception here
- Venice, which is also a geographical peculiarity in lots of ways
