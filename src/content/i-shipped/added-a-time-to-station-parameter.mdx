VBB-AnyBar is a tool that shows Berlin public transit departures using a little coloured dot in your menu bar. I added a "time to station" setting so the app can account for how long it takes you to walk (or cycle, or drive) to the station, making its departure alerts actually useful for knowing when to leave.
