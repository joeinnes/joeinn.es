# Description
Since the nav menu update, docs are out of position compared to their places in the nav menu. This PR:

1. Moves docs to the new location
2. Updates the URLs in the nav menu to ensure the correct mapping
3. Updates internal links
4. 301 redirects the previous links to their new location

## Manual testing instructions

I used https://www.npmjs.
