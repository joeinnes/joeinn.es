FlipDown is a JavaScript countdown timer with a retro flip-clock style. The labels for the time units (days, hours, minutes, seconds) were hardcoded in English. I added an option to customize these headings, which is handy for using the timer in other languages or for changing labels like "Days" to "Jours" in French.
