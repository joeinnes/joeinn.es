summary: set encoding as UTF-8 in diff_match_patch.php

Codiad is a code editor that runs in a web browser. Its file-comparison feature was breaking when files contained special characters (like accented letters), because it wasn't explicitly set to handle UTF-8 encoding. I added the UTF-8 encoding declaration so that comparing files with non-English characters works correctly.
