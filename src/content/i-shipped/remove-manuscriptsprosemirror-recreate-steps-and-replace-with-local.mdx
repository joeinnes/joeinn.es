### Problem

The `@manuscripts/prosemirror-recreate-steps` package pulls in transitive dependencies with known vulnerabilities. The package is also unmaintained and provides significantly more functionality than we actually use.

### Solution

Replaced the external dependency with a local `recreateTransform` implementation that uses ProseMirror's built-in `Fragment.
