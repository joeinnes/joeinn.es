Jazz uses a rich text editor library called ProseMirror for collaborative editing. One of the packages it depended on had known security vulnerabilities and was no longer maintained. I replaced it with a much simpler, locally-written version that does just what Jazz actually needs, removing the security risk and the unnecessary bloat.
