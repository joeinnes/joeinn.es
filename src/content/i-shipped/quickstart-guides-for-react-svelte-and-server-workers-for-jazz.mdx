Previously, users who wanted to get started with Jazz could either use the command line tool to scaffold a project, or they could work through an installation tutorial which covers the practical side of getting Jazz added to an app, but doesn't guide folks to an 'ah ha!' moment.

I wrote a quickstart guide which works for both React and Svelte, and added a follow up which shows how to use Jazz on the server with a worker. These guides will help users understand the core concepts of Jazz.
