Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. One of the example projects in the Jazz repo needed a secret key stored in a config file, but that file isn't checked into source control for security reasons. This meant the project would fail to build for anyone cloning the repo fresh. I added a script that automatically generates the missing config file so builds just work out of the box.
