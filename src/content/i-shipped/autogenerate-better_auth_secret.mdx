summary: autogenerate BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

Currently, building the monorepo fails because the `betterauth-svelte` example imports `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` from `$env/static/private`, which requires a `.env` file to exist. Since `.env` is gitignored, fresh clones and CI always hit this error:

```
Error: Module '"$env/static/private"' has no exported member 'BETTER_AUTH_SECRET'.
```

This PR adds a small Node script (`scripts/ensure-env.
