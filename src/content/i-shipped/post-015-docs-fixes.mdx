Fixes a few minor docs issues:

1. References to v0.14 being the most recent release removed
2. Adds a warning that AccountSchema still needs to be passed to the provider (this part of the upgrade guide was misunderstood by quite a few people, myself included)
3. Adds notes clarifying the requirement to use Node.js v20 in the installation guides for all frameworks and the create-jazz-app doc.
