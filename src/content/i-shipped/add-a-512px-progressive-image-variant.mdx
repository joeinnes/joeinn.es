Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. When you upload an image, Jazz automatically creates smaller versions of it so they load faster. The existing sizes jumped from 256px straight to 1024px, which meant medium-sized images (like in a sidebar or card) had to either load a tiny version or wait for a much larger one. I added a 512px in-between size so images load more smoothly in those situations.
