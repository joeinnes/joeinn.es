summary: fix issue when code sample is formatted

The Jazz docs have code examples that hide certain lines to keep things simple. In the Svelte permissions guide, a "hide this line" marker was only hiding the first line of a multi-line block of code, leaving extra lines visible that shouldn't have been shown. I fixed the formatting so the right lines are hidden.
