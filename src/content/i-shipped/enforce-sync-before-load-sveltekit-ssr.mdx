summary: enforce sync before load (SvelteKit SSR)

When you changed data in a Jazz app and then navigated to a server-rendered page, the server could show stale information because the changes hadn't finished syncing yet. I added an optional `navigation` prop to the Svelte provider that automatically waits for pending syncs to complete before letting the page transition happen, so the server always has the latest data.
