Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps that store data locally on your device. I added a button to Jazz's built-in developer tools that lets you clear all your local data, which is useful for testing and debugging. It comes with a clear warning so you don't accidentally delete things, and I also built a reusable confirmation dialog to go with it.
