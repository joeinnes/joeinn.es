Zed is a high-performance code editor. When you made a Git commit from within Zed's built-in Git panel, there was no visual indication that anything was happening if it took a moment. Users would sometimes click the button repeatedly, thinking it hadn't worked. I changed the button text to appear dimmed while a commit is in progress, so you can tell it's working.
