  git_ui: Give visual feedback when an operation is pending
repo: zed-industries/zed
mergeDate: 2025-11-01
prNumber: '41686'

Currently, if a commit operation takes some time, there's no visual feedback in the UI that anything's happening.

This PR changes the colour of the text on the button to the `Color::Disabled` colour when a commit operation is pending.

Release Notes:

- Improved UI feedback in the Git panel when a commit is in progress.
- Let's Git Together
