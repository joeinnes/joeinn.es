By default, all credentials are stored under `jazz` but this makes it impossible to avoid namespace clashes (for example, if you have multiple apps running on the same domain, or in case you want to do local development of more than one Jazz app at a time.

This PR extends on work that was already done to add an option to the Svelte provider, allowing users to specify the prefix under which their credentials will be stored.
