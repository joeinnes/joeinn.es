  an update to the podspec file to make the react-native-image-resizer
  compatible with Expo 54
repo: bamtech/react-native-image-resizer
prNumber: '429'

Since Expo 54, React Native has been shipped precompiled for iOS. This meant that the previous dependency for react-native-image-resizer, RCT-Folly, could no longer be found as it's no longer available as a pod. I updated the podspec file to detect whether React Native is precompiled or not, and if not, then compile RCT-Folly as a dependency.
