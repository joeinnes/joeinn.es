# Description
The `TabbedCodeGroup` component emits custom events on the window when the user changes framework to allow all parts of the docs to update.

However, the `useFramework` hook which feeds the current framework to the `ContentByFramework` component wasn't listening to these changes, so the content contained within was stuck at whatever it was when the page was first loaded.
