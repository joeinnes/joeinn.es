Jazz's documentation site lets you switch between different frameworks (like React and Svelte) to see relevant code examples. I fixed a bug where some parts of the page wouldn't update when you switched frameworks -- they'd stay stuck showing the one you first loaded. Now the whole page updates consistently when you pick a different framework.
