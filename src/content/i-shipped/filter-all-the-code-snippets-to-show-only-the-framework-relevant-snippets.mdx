summary: filter all the code snippets to show only the framework relevant snippets

Jazz supports multiple web frameworks like React, Svelte, and Vue. The docs used to show code examples for all frameworks at once, which was confusing. I updated the documentation build system so that when you select a framework, you only see code snippets relevant to that framework, keeping things clean and focused.
