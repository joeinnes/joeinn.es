Directus is an open-source headless CMS. Its JavaScript SDK had a bug where users would get unexpectedly logged out after refreshing the page, even though their login session was still valid. I fixed it so the SDK automatically checks and refreshes the login token when it starts up, keeping users properly signed in.
