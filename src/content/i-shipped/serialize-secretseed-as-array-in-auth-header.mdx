summary: serialize secretSeed as array in auth header

Jazz uses secret keys for user authentication, but these keys were being incorrectly converted when sent between the server and browser -- they were being turned into an object format instead of a simple list of numbers. I fixed the conversion so the keys are sent in the right format and can be properly used on the client side for login features like passphrases and passkeys.
