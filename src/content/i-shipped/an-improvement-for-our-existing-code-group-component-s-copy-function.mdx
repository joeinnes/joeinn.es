summary: an improvement for our existing CodeGroup component's copy function
repo: garden-co/jazz
prNumber: '2991'
---
We have a CodeGroup component which allows us to display some code with a copy button. This CodeGroup allows us to write special comments like `// [!code --:1]` to mark a line as 'removed'. However, these were still being copied, resulting in inaccurate code snippets being copied when users clicked the button.

This PR removes those lines from the copied text.
