FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge where you print numbers but replace some with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz". This repo collects creative solutions in different languages and styles. I contributed a deliberately ugly JavaScript one-liner using nested ternary operators -- because sometimes the fun is in making it as unreadable as possible.
