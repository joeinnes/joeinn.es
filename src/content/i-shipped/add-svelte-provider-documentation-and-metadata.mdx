Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps, and it supports several UI frameworks including Svelte. The docs page for Svelte's "provider" setup (how you connect your Svelte app to Jazz) was incomplete. I filled in the missing documentation so Svelte developers can properly set up Jazz in their apps.
