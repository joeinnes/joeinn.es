  fix `toJSON()` serialisation for `co.record`
repo: garden-co/jazz
mergeDate: 2026-02-07
prNumber: '3444'
---
The catchall on CoRecords was trapping the `toJSON` call, resulting in incorrect serialisation behaviour of nested CoRecords.

Tests have been added.

> [!NOTE]
> **Low Risk**
> Scoped to serialization/schema lookup logic and adds targeted test coverage; low risk aside from potential edge cases in proxy trapping for non-string keys.
