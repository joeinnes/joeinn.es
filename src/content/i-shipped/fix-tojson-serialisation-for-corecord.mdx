Jazz uses special data structures called CoRecords to store collaborative data. When you tried to convert a nested CoRecord to JSON (a common data format), the result was wrong because an internal mechanism was intercepting the conversion. I fixed the serialization logic so nested data structures convert to JSON correctly, and added tests to prevent this from breaking again.
