summary: a docs update regarding credential persistence on iOS
repo: garden-co/jazz
mergeDate: 2025-11-24
prNumber: '3200'

When a Jazz app is uninstalled, all data is deleted *except* the login credentials on iOS which are persisted to the keychain. This can cause issues if the account is not synced and the user reinstalls the app.
