AGENTS.md is a file that helps AI coding assistants understand a project. I added a comprehensive index of Jazz's documentation to this file, so that AI tools like Claude and Cursor can more easily find and reference the right docs when helping developers. I also wrote a script that automatically regenerates this index whenever the docs are built, so it stays up to date.
