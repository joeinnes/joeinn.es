summary: a refactoring of our useFramework hook

In our docs, we have a hook which fetches the current framework, however, there were other bits of code around the codebase which do similar things, and the hook was becoming unwieldy and difficult to follow.

I refactored the `useFramework` hook to make it easier to use, and improve the separation of concerns on the homepage docs.
