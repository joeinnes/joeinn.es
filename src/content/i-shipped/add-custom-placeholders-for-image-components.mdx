# Description
Since Jazz v0.17.0, we've defaulted to *not* generating placeholder images by default. This meant that some users were surprised on upgrading to see flashes of alt text instead of a loading image.

Although this is the browser's default behaviour, the experience can be somewhat jarring.

This PR allows users to specify custom placeholder images (e.g. their brand).
