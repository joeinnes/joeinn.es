Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. After a recent update, images in Jazz apps would briefly flash their alt text while loading instead of showing a placeholder, which looked jarring. I added the ability for developers to specify their own custom placeholder image (like a company logo or branded loading graphic) so their apps look polished while images load in.
