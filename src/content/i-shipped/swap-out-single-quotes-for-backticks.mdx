If you try to bind a pop-up with an apostrophe in, then it will cause an error and the map won't load. Switching to template literals fixes this. Although this is arguably not a safe way to do this, it is no worse than it currently is. (eg: you could write a 'popup' containing the text `'); alert('xss');var ignore = '` which would also allow XSS attacks.
