This is a Leaflet maps plugin for OctoberCMS. If a map marker's popup text contained an apostrophe (like "Joe's Coffee"), the whole map would break and refuse to load. I fixed this by switching from single quotes to template literals in the code, so apostrophes in popup content no longer crash the map.
