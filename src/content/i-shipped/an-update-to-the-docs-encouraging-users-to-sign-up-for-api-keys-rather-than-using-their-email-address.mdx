We launched our cloud dashboard recently, allowing users to sign up for API keys rather than using their email address. However, across all of our docs, we had verbiage that users should use their email as a temporary API key.

This PR addresses that by changing the wording to drive traffic to our dashboard instead of recommending email addresses.
