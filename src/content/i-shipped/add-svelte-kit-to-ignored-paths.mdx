Vercel's Workflow SDK helps you build long-running background tasks. SvelteKit (a web framework) generates a build folder called `.svelte-kit` that should be ignored by tools watching for file changes. I added it to the ignore list so the workflow SDK doesn't unnecessarily process those generated files.
