John Wargo has created a tool which you can run using `npx @johnwargo/link-checker` to check for broken links on a website, which was really helpful as I was trying to scan through the whole of the Jazz docs to identify broken links.

The problem was that it didn't show where the link appeared, only the broken link itself.

I added a column to the output which shows *where* the broken link appears on the site.
