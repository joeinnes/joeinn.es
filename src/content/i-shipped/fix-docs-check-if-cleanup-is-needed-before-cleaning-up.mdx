  fix docs: check if cleanup is needed before cleaning up

TinaCMS is a content management system that lets you edit Markdown files visually. The docs had a code example that could crash if the editor hadn't fully loaded before the cleanup code ran. I added a check to make sure the editor is actually ready before trying to clean it up, preventing the error.
