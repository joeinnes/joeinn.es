In principle, according to the WebAuthn spec, cryptographic challenges *should* be at least 16 bytes long, however in our existing implementation, we had 3 bytes. Although this is technically within spec, it was causing issues for some users using third party passkey managers such as KeePassXC.

This PR builds on previous work and extends the challenge length to 20 bytes.
