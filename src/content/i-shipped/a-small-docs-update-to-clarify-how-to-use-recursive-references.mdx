Our existing docs explained how to use getters to recursively reference schemas, but weren't very clear about how to avoid `ReferenceError`s caused by schemas creating circular references which resulted in references being evaluated while they were still in the temporal dead zone.

I added some additional keywords and explanation to help folks find these docs more easily when they're searching, as well as explaining the use cases in a bit more detail.
