Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. The docs site has a minimal to-do list example on its landing page, but the icon was an external image that couldn't adapt to dark mode. I inlined the SVG so it can be styled with CSS, meaning it now automatically adjusts its colours when someone has dark mode enabled on their device.
