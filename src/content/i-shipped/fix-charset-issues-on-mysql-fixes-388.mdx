Umami is a privacy-focused web analytics tool (like a simpler, open-source alternative to Google Analytics). When using MySQL as the database, special characters weren't being stored correctly because the database tables weren't set up with the right character encoding. I fixed this by making sure tables are created with UTF-8 support, so all characters display properly.
