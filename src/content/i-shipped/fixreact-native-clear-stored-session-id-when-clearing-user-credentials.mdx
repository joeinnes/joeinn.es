  fix(react-native): clear stored session ID when clearing user credentials

When a user logged out of a Jazz React Native app, their session ID was accidentally left behind in secure storage even though the rest of their credentials were removed. I fixed the logout function to also clean up the session ID, so there's no leftover authentication data after signing out.
