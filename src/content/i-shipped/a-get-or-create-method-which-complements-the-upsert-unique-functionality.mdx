summary: a `getOrCreate` method which complements the `upsertUnique` functionality

prNumber: '2997'

Currently, users can `upsertUnique`, allowing them to specify a piece of unique data to be used to generate the header for their CoValue. This existing function will either create or overwrite any CoValue with that specific uniqueness.

The new function I built allows users to specify what they would like to be there if data does *not* already exist, but if a CoValue with that specific uniqueness *does* already exist, to simply return it, rather than overwriting it.
