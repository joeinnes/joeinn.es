Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. When something goes wrong while loading data, apps need a way to gracefully show an error message instead of crashing. I added documentation explaining how to use React's Suspense and Error Boundary features with Jazz, so developers know how to handle loading states and errors properly.
