We were previously warning users to avoid using `never` and `signedUp` on iOS, as this could result in credentials being cached to the keychain, which would not be deleted when deleting the app. In this case, if the user re-installed the app, their client could crash, as the account for which the credentials were created no longer existed. We now recommend that users who want to keep completely local data without syncing use a randomised prefix for their credentials, and store this in the `Settings` (which *is* deleted on app uninstallation).
