Someone built a minimal example app to demonstrate a bug with Jazz and Svelte, but the example itself had issues. I fixed the reactivity (making the UI update properly when data changes) by using Svelte's built-in `$derived` feature, and also added graceful handling for missing images instead of crashing. I also added the Jazz Inspector debugging tool to help with further troubleshooting.
