Apostrophe Monitor is a tool that watches over an ApostropheCMS website and restarts it if it crashes. Previously, if the CMS couldn't start at all (for example, due to a code error), the monitor would just give up and exit. I changed it so that the monitor stays running and shows a helpful error page in the browser instead, giving you time to fix the problem without losing the monitoring process.
