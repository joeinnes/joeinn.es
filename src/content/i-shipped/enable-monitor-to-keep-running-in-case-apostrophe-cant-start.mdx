  enable monitor to keep running in case Apostrophe can't start
repo: apostrophecms-legacy/apostrophe-monitor

Current behaviour: if Apostrophe can't start (eg: syntax error in a module's index.js), monitor exits to the terminal.

This PR allows monitor to continue running in case Apostrophe doesn't start, and instead runs a basic HTTP server which will return the error message and stack dump, until the error is fixed and Apostrophe can run successfully again.
