# Description
Homepage builds are failing since merging 3178 but 3178 built successfully in preview: https://vercel.com/gcmp/jazz-homepage/4GFURBFsp8apUe3zuKqcnKDyCyKW

I still don't know why the `// @ts-expect-error` is causing issues on Vercel but not locally (in fact, the opposite), but this will unblock homepage builds while I work it out.
