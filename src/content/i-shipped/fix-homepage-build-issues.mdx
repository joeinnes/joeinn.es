summary: fix homepage build issues
repo: garden-co/jazz
mergeDate: 2025-11-13
prNumber: '3179'

The Jazz homepage stopped building after a recent change added a new dependency that made a previously-needed TypeScript workaround invalid. I removed the outdated workaround and added a proper type check, which got the homepage building and deploying again.
