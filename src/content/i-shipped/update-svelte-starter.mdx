Jazz is a framework for building real-time collaborative apps. After a previous change required all example apps to use an API key from a configuration file, the Svelte starter template would crash if that file was missing. I fixed it so the app loads the key dynamically instead, meaning new developers can get started without hitting an error on their first run.
