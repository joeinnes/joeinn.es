summary: move codecs under schema and republish link
repo: garden-co/jazz

The Jazz documentation had a page about codecs (tools for converting data between formats) that had become unlinked and unreachable from the navigation menu. I moved it under the "Schemas" section where it logically belongs and re-added the link so people can find it again.
