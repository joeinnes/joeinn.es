Twoslash is a code-highlighting and type-checking plugin which helps to make sure all our code samples are kept up to date. Unfortunately though, it causes our build times to be very slow.

I extracted all of our code samples into separate files, and developed a new way of integrating them into our docs. This led to huge speed wins, bringing our build times down by around 5 minutes per build (on Vercel), roughly 14 hours of compute per month.

It also brought even more significant savings in terms of development. Where previously, it took me (M4 Macbook Pro) 110s to compile the docs in dev mode, now it takes 7s, a speed increase of 15×, making it much easier to develop our homepage and our docs overall.
