  'catch'` being set

Normally, Jazz will throw if it cannot complete a resolve query as requested by the user (for example because the user doesn't have access to the data or it doesn't actually exist). Users can override this by specifying `$onError: 'catch'`, which will instead return the rest of the query completed correctly with only the CoValue in question missing.

There was a bug in how this was implemented which I fixed.
