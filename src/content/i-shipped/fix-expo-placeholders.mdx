# Description
Expo Image Manipulator returns a bare base64 string, which means that the images uploaded from Expo clients had invalid placeholders.

This fixes. 

## Manual testing instructions
Build and install the chat app, upload some images. Check that the placeholder URL is correctly set with the `data` prefix.
