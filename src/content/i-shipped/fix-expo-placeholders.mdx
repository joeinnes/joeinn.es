summary: fix expo placeholders

Jazz apps can show low-quality placeholder images while the full-resolution version loads. On Expo (a React Native framework for mobile apps), uploaded images had broken placeholders because the image data was missing a required prefix. I added the missing `data:` prefix so placeholder images display correctly on mobile.
