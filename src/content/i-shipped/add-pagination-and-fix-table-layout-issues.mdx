My drinks tracking app was showing all entries in one big list, which got unwieldy. I added pagination with Previous/Next buttons so you can browse through entries page by page. I also fixed a layout bug where long drink names would stretch the table and break the page, and corrected how alcohol percentages are displayed so they don't show excessive decimal places.
