Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps. I added a set of "skills" -- reference documents that AI coding assistants like Claude and Cursor can use to write better Jazz code. These cover topics like performance optimization, permissions, UI integration, and testing, so that when you ask an AI to help you build a Jazz app, it has detailed, accurate guidance to draw on.
