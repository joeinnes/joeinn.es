Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps, and its docs site lets you switch between different platforms. I greyed out the quickstart guides in the navigation menu when viewing React Native or Expo, since those quickstarts haven't been written yet. This way, users aren't misled into clicking links that lead nowhere.
