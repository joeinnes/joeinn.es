This was a huge piece of work ahead of SyncConf 2025. I built a Jazz-based step sequencer in SvelteKit. Users can collaborate on an 8 beat grid to trigger various one-shot samples in a musical sequence.

The demo is aimed at iPad screen size, and includes primitive sync logic to make sure that devices sound in sync when played simultaneously. This was particularly challenging, and I eventually did it based on calculating clock skew roughly based on a heartbeat from the Jazz mesh. I would like to explore using Jazz as a WebRTC signalling channel.
