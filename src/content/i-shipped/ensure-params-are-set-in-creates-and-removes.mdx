Feathers-vuex is a library that connects Vue.js apps to Feathers.js, a real-time API framework. A recent update to Feathers accidentally broke things by not always including required request parameters, causing crashes. I added a safety check so that parameters are always set when creating or removing data, preventing "undefined" errors even if the upstream library has a hiccup.
