Most of our users need basic features like authentication and collaboration in their apps, but the guides we have are currently very reference-y and not so much practical implementation guides.

I wrote one guide that covers permissions in Jazz using groups, and how to share data and collaborate on it, and a second which shows how to add passkey authentication into your app using the basic passkey UI.

This should make it easier for users to build an app with the kind of features a real-world app needs.
