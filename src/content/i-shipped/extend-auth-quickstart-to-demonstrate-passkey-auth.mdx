Jazz is a framework for building collaborative apps, and its docs site had a quickstart guide for authentication. I extended this guide to show how to add passkey login (the kind where you use your fingerprint or face to sign in) alongside other auth methods, so developers can see how to offer multiple ways for users to log in.
